# MovieRecommender
- This repository contains a homework I completed for my data science class during my Senior year at Bucknell University
- Using a movie rating dataset provided by the grouplens research group found here:  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ my partner
and I used pandas, sklearn and mlextend to perform Association rule mining and find frequent patterns.
- We found strong rules to determine what a given User might watch next based on their watch history and performed the same task to suggest
a subset of said movies based on a desired genre.
